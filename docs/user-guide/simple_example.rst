Getting Started with OpenMDAO: A Simple Example Problem
=======================================================

The purpose of this section is to teach the novice user how to set up and
execute a simple optimization problem using the OpenMDAO script interface. This
tutorial assumes that the user is familiar (though not necessarily proficient)
with the Python language and has a reasonable understanding of the concepts
presented in :ref:`Overview-of-the-OpenMDAO-Framework`, particularly the
concepts of the :term:`Component`, :term:`Assembly`, and :term:`Driver`.

The problem presented here is a paraboloid that is a function of two design 
variables. The optimization goal is to find the minimum values of this function
over the design space. For the simplest form of this problem, there are no
constraints, and the analytical derivative of the objective function is assumed
to be unavailable. The problem can be expressed graphically as follows:


.. _`OpenMDAO_overview`:

.. figure:: ../../examples/openmdao.examples.simple/openmdao/examples/simple/Simple1.png
   :align: center

   A Simple Optimization Problem
   
This graphical view of the problem also helps in understanding how to map the
problem onto the OpenMDAO framework. The CONMIN optimizer is the :term:`Driver`,
and its job is to manipulate the two design variables (*x* and *y*) in order to 
minimize the output of the paraboloid function (*f*). The objective equation fits
into the OpenMDAO process as a :term:`component`. More specifically, this 
Paraboloid component contains an execute function which takes the inputs 
(*x* and *y*) and returns the value of the function (*f*) evaluated at that design 
point. Finally, both the driver and the component are contained in an 
:term:`assembly` which maintains the connections between the driver and the
component, and knows how to run the system.

The Python code for this example problem can be found here:

	``examples/openmdao.examples.simple/openmdao/examples/simple``

Building a Simple Component - Paraboloid
-----------------------------------------

At the highest level, a component is simply something that takes a set of
inputs and operates on them, producing a set of outputs. In the OpenMDAO
architecture, a class called :term:`Component` provides this behavior. Any
component has inputs and outputs and contains a function that executes the
component. This function operates on the inputs to produce the outputs. Our
purpose in creating a component for the Paraboloid equation is to provide an
object that can evaluate the objective function during the optimization process.
The Python code for the Paraboloid component is as follows:

.. testcode:: simple_component_Paraboloid

    from enthought.traits.api import Float
    from openmdao.main.api import Component
    
    class Paraboloid(Component):
        """ Evaluates the equation (x-3)^2 + xy + (y+4)^2 = 3 """
    
	# set up interface to the framework  
	x = Float(0.0, io_direction='in', desc='The variable y')
        y = Float(0.0, io_direction='in', desc='The variable x')

        f_xy = Float(0.0, io_direction='out', desc='F(x,y)')        

        
	def execute(self):
	    """ Solve (x-3)^2 + xy + (y+4)^2 = 3
	        Optimal solution (minimum): x = 6.6667; y = -7.3333
	        """
        
	    x = self.x
	    y = self.y
        
	    self.f_xy = (x-3.0)**2 + x*y + (y+4.0)**2 - 3.0

The details of this will now be explained. One thing to note is that a component
is implemented in the OpenMDAO framework by writing Python code and placing
it in a file. Typically, a file will contain one component, although it is 
possible to include more than one component in a single file. The file 
paraboloid.py contains the code shown above. How to execute a model containing
this component will be discussed later in this tutorial.

Python is a very extensible language and comes with a convenient way to manage
and load add-ons and extensions. The OpenMDAO source was also structured to
allow its functions and classes to follow a namespace convention (i.e., dotted
paths that compartmentalize the functions). Additionally, a special namespace
called ``openmdao.main.api`` was added, which contains some of the more commonly
used functions.

.. testcode:: simple_component_Paraboloid_pieces

    from enthought.traits.api import Float
    from openmdao.main.api import Component
    
These first two lines in the Paraboloid component contain the two inputs that
are used here: *Float* and *Component.* One guideline that should always be followed
is to import only what you need.

The very next line creates a class called Paraboloid:

.. testcode:: simple_component_Paraboloid_pieces

    class Paraboloid(Component):
        """ Evaluates the equation (x-3)^2 + xy + (y+4)^2 = 3 """
	
At this point, it is essential that the component developer has a clear
understanding of the distinction between classes and functions. On the surface
it would appear that we merely need a function that can take two inputs and
return an output, and for an example this simple, such a case could be made.
However, object-oriented programming allows much more complicated systems to be
described without increasing the complexity of the framework code. A flexible
framework like OpenMDAO probably could not be implemented without objects, and
even if it could, it would be complex and difficult to maintain.

So, this line of Python code defines the Paraboloid class by deriving it from
the Component class. This means that a Paraboloid is a Component, so it contains
all of the data and functions that a Component contains. This includes a lot of
helper functions that are used by the framework infrastructure to manage things.
Another side benefit is that the user doesn't have to worry about any of the
framework back-end; there are just two functions that a typical user will
provide -- one for initialization (any calculation that needs to be done
before the optimization loop), and one to execute the component (provide the 
objective evaluation.)

Note that if we stop here, we have a Paraboloid component with no inputs, no 
outputs, and an execute function that does nothing. The first thing we need
to do is to define the inputs and outputs. This is done in the class definition
by adding these lines:

.. testcode:: simple_component_Paraboloid_pieces

	# set up interface to the framework  
	x = Float(0.0, io_direction='in', desc='The variable y')
        y = Float(0.0, io_direction='in', desc='The variable x')

        f_xy = Float(0.0, io_direction='out', desc='F(x,y)')  
	
OpenMDAO implements framework variables using a Python add-on called :term:`Traits`.
This is an open-source extension to Python that was put out by a company called
Enthought. Traits provide a way to apply explicit typing to the normally untyped
Python variables. They also provide the capability to add some other features to
the framework variables, including unit checking and conversion, default values,
minima and maxima, and a way to create callback functions.

Here we are using a trait called *Float,* which was imported above, that creates
a floating point variable available to the framework. The constructor contains
a default value (set to 0 for these), an io_direction (which declares this 
variable as an input or an output), and a description (just a string of text
that describes this variable -- this will be more useful in the GUI.) For the
Paraboloid component, we've created two inputs and one output. Note that the two
inputs can be set by something else in the model, whether that be triggered
by an optimization or by the change of some other component output to which
this input is connected. The variable names are limited to those names that are
valid as Python variables.

Finally, we need a function to execute this component:

.. testcode:: simple_component_Paraboloid_pieces

	def execute(self):
	    """ Solve (x-3)^2 + xy + (y+4)^2 = 3
	        Optimal solution (minimum): x = 6.6667; y = -7.3333
	        """
        
	    x = self.x
	    y = self.y
        
	    self.f_xy = (x-3.0)**2 + x*y + (y+4.0)**2 - 3.0
	    
The execute function is where you define what a component will do when it is
told to run. For the Paraboloid component, the
equation for the paraboloid goes here. Note that the framework variables are 
accessed as members of the Paraboloid class, meaning that *self.x* returns the
value of the framework input *x.* To make the equation clearer, *self.x* was
to *x* and *self.y* was assigned to *y* before the equation. Note also that the
output value is assigned here similarly via *self.f_xy.* This changes the value
of the framework variable and completes the component execution.

It will often be the case that a component developer will already have the code
for evaluating the objective function, but it will be in some other language
such as FORTRAN or C/C++. Section ??? gives some examples of how to incorporate
these kinds of components into OpenMDAO.

The Paraboloid component is now built and ready for inclusion in a model.


Building a Simple Model - Unconstrained Optimization using CONMIN
------------------------------------------------------------------

The next task is to build a model that finds the minimum objective value for the
Paraboloid component described above. This model will contain the Paraboloid as well as
a public domain gradient optimizer called :term:`CONMIN`, for which a Python-wrapped
driver has been included in the OpenMDAO standard library. The model can be found in
the Python file optimization_unconstrained.py:

.. testcode:: simple_model_Unconstrained

	from openmdao.main.api import Assembly
	from openmdao.lib.drivers.conmindriver import CONMINdriver
	from openmdao.examples.simple.paraboloid import Paraboloid

	class Optimization_Unconstrained(Assembly):
    	    """ Top level assembly for optimizing a vehicle. """
    
    	    def __init__(self, directory=''):
                """ Creates a new Assembly containing a Paraboloid and an optimizer"""
        
	        super(Optimization_Unconstrained, self).__init__(directory)

	        # Create Paraboloid component instances
	        self.add_container('paraboloid', Paraboloid())

	        # Create CONMIN Optimizer instance
	        self.add_driver('driver', CONMINdriver())
        
	        # CONMIN Flags
	        self.driver.iprint = 0
	        self.driver.itmax = 30
	        self.driver.fdch = .000001
	        self.driver.fdchm = .000001
        
	        # CONMIN Objective 
	        self.driver.objective = 'paraboloid.f_xy'
        
	        # CONMIN Design Variables 
	        self.driver.design_vars = ['paraboloid.x', 
	                                 'paraboloid.y' ]
        
	        self.driver.lower_bounds = [-50, -50]
        	self.driver.upper_bounds = [50, 50]


.. index:: Top Level Assembly
 		
In OpenMDAO parlance, we usually describe this as the *Top Level Assembly.* An 
assembly is a container that can hold some number of components, drivers, and 
other assemblies. An assembly also manages the interconnections between the
components and assemblies that it owns, and it has its own workflow, which it
uses to execute the components and drivers in the correct order. For our
problem, this Top Level Assembly will include a Paraboloid component and a 
CONMIN driver. It will tell the CONMIN driver when to run and what to run.

Note that this is an assembly, so the class is derived from Assembly instead
of Component. This gives it access to the management functions mentioned above.

.. testsetup:: simple_model_Unconstrained_pieces

	from openmdao.main.api import Assembly
	from openmdao.lib.drivers.conmindriver import CONMINdriver
	from openmdao.examples.simple.paraboloid import Paraboloid
	from openmdao.examples.simple.optimization_unconstrained import Optimization_Unconstrained
	
	self = Optimization_Unconstrained()
	
.. testcode:: simple_model_Unconstrained_pieces

	class Optimization_Unconstrained(Assembly):
    	    """ Top level assembly for optimizing a vehicle. """
    
For the Paraboloid component, we created an execute function to tell it what to
do when the component is run. This is not needed for the 
Optimization_Unconstrained assembly because the Assembly class already has an
execution function that should be usable for most cases. However, this assembly
does need an initialize function to set parameters for the optimization. This
is done using the __init__ function.

.. testcode:: simple_model_Unconstrained_pieces

    	    def __init__(self, directory=''):
                """ Creates a new Assembly containing a Paraboloid and an optimizer"""
        
	        super(Optimization_Unconstrained, self).__init__(directory)

.. index:: StringRef, constructor
		
This initialize function is actually a special function called a *constructor,*
which is the function that instantiates an object. The double leading and
trailing underscores are a required part of the syntax. This function executes
once when the Top Level Assembly is created, so it's a good spot to set up
any parameters that are needed for CONMIN. The *super* command calls the
constructor of the parent (Assembly); this is also required.

Next, the Paraboloid and the CONMIN driver have to be created (instantiated.)
This is done using the function *add_container,* which is one of the framework
management functions that are part of the Assembly class.

.. testcode:: simple_model_Unconstrained_pieces

	        # Create Paraboloid component instances
	        self.add_container('paraboloid', Paraboloid())

	        # Create CONMIN Optimizer instance
	        self.add_driver('driver', CONMINdriver())
		
Here, a Paraboloid component is created, and given the name *paraboloid.* Similarly
a CONMIN driver is created and given the name *driver.* As with other class
members, these now become accessible via self.paraboloid and self.driver.
		
The objective function is defined using the concept of a StringRef variable:		
        
.. testcode:: simple_model_Unconstrained_pieces

	        # CONMIN Objective 
	        self.driver.objective = 'paraboloid.f_xy'
		
A *StringRef* is a special kind of trait that contains a string that points to
some location in the OpenMDAO variable tree. This string is analogous to the
path name in a file system, using the "." as a separator. This allows for two
components to have the same variable name while still assuring they'll be
uniquely referable. Here, the *f_xy* output of the Paraboloid component is
selected as the objective for minimization.

StringRefs are also used to define the design variables (decision variables)
for the optimization problem. While CONMIN operates only on a single objective,
it allows multiple design variables. These are assigned in a Python list:
        
.. testcode:: simple_model_Unconstrained_pieces

	        # CONMIN Design Variables 
	        self.driver.design_vars = ['paraboloid.x', 
	                                 'paraboloid.y' ]
					 
Here, both *x* and *y* are chosen as the design variables. We can also add a range
of validity for these variables. CONMIN provides a specialized constraint
called a *Side Constraint,* which allows an unconstrained optimization to be
performed on what is essentially a bounded problem. For this problem, we have
created a lower and an upper bound, constraining *x* and *y* to lie on [-50, 50].
        
.. testcode:: simple_model_Unconstrained_pieces

	        self.driver.lower_bounds = [-50, -50]
        	self.driver.upper_bounds = [50, 50]

The problem is now essentially ready to execute. CONMIN contains quite a few
additional control parameters; these are detailed in :ref:`CONMIN-driver`.
		
.. testcode:: simple_model_Unconstrained_pieces

	        # CONMIN Flags
	        self.driver.iprint = 0
	        self.driver.itmax = 30
	        self.driver.fdch = .000001
	        self.driver.fdchm = .000001

The ones used here include the debug verbosity (iprint) and the number of
iterations (itmax.) Additionally, the relative and absolute step sizes for the
numerical gradient calculation are adjusted to reduce the step size for this
problem (*fdch* and *fdchm*). If the default values are used, only two places of
accuracy can be obtained in the calculated minimum because the default step
size is too large for this problem.
		
Executing the Simple Optimization Problem
-----------------------------------------

In the absence of the OpenMDAO GUI, one other step must be taken to set up and execute
this optimization problem. The Top Level Assembly has to be created and told to run. One
convenient way to do this is to include some code in the Top Level Assembly file that
allows execution in Python, either at the command line or in the shell. Using the check
``if __name__ == "__main__":`` some Python code can be included at the bottom of
optimization_unconstrained.py which executes only when it is called at the command line or
the shell. So, the final lines in this file are:

.. testsetup:: simple_model_Unconstrained_run

	from openmdao.examples.simple.optimization_unconstrained import Optimization_Unconstrained
	__name__ = "__main__"

.. testcode:: simple_model_Unconstrained_run

	if __name__ == "__main__": 

	    opt_problem = Optimization_Unconstrained("Top")
	    opt_problem.run()

	    print "Minimum found at (%f, %f)" % (opt_problem.paraboloid.get("x"), \
                                                 opt_problem.paraboloid.get("y"))
						 
This can be executed in the shell by going to the
``examples/openmdao.examples.simple/openmdao/examples/simple`` directory, and typing:

::

        ../../../../../bin/python optimization_unconstrained.py
	
This should produce the output:

.. testoutput:: simple_model_Unconstrained_run

    Minimum found at (6.666309, -7.333026)

An Optimization_Unconstrained Top Level Assembly is instantiated and given the
name *opt_problem.* This created the problem and instantiates a Paraboloid and
a CONMIN driver. The run function is used to run the model, which solves the
optimization problem as set up above. Finally, the final design variables are
accessed using the get function on the Paraboloid component, which is
accessible even from outside the Top Level Assembly.


Building a Simple Model - Constrained Optimization using CONMIN

Coming Soon.

This concludes a simple introduction to component creation and execution in
OpenMDAO. The next tutorial section presents a problem with more complexity and
presents some more of the features.
