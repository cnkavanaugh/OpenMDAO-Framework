message:
  T398 - Script generators for go-openmdao.py and go-openmdao-dev.py were consolidated
  into a single python script (mkinstaller.py). Optional arg --reqs was added to 
  go-openmdao*.py, allowing a user to specify a file containing additional dependencies
  to install into the openmdao environment. Release building scripts were also 
  updated to allow a new openmdao release to be deployed on a local web server 
  and tested locally before being uploaded to openmdao.org.
