This version of Pyipopt is slightly different than the version
distributed by Eric Xu. Some code was cleaned up.

Also, Pyipopt and Ipopt itself were slightly modified to handle
exceptions better. The included files

    IpStdCInterface.cpp
    IpReturnCodes_inc.h

add code to Ipopt so that when Ipopt's OptimizeTNLP method
causes an exception, that can be captured and returned to
Pyipopt as a new status value. So to use this code you need to 
build Ipopt with these modifications. The modifications
were made to Ipopt 3.9.1.
