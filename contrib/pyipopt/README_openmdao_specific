This version of Pyipopt is slightly different than the version
distributed by Eric Xu. Some code was cleaned up.

To build Pyipopt, environment variables need to be set to point to the 
location of the Ipopt include files and libraries. For example, here is
how this would be done on a Linux machine.

    export COIN_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/username/local/include/coin/
    export COIN_LIB_DIR=/home/username/local/lib/coin/
    export COIN_THIRDPARTY_LIB_DIR=/home/username/local/lib/coin/ThirdParty

This version of Pyipopt and Ipopt was tested using following third party libraries:

     BLAS
     LAPACK
     METIS
     MUMPS Linear Solver
     Harwell Subroutine Library - ma27ad.f and mc19ad.f
